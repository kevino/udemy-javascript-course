Coding Challenge #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Hint: Use an if/else statement 😉

GOOD LUCK

Test data:
Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

const markWeight = 78;
const markHeight = 1.69;
const johnWeight = 92;
const johnHeight = 1.95;

const markBMI = markWeight / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBMI = johnWeight / johnHeight ** 2;

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's BMI (${johnBMI}).`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's BMI (${markBMI}).`);
}
